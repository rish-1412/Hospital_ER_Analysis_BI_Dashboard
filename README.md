## Overview
This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** focused on **Hospital Emergency Room Analysis**, offering valuable insights into emergency room operations, patient demographics, and service efficiency. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as patient admission trends, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and departmental referrals, enabling healthcare providers to better understand patient flow and operational challenges. By analyzing these patterns across different time frames and demographics, stakeholders can enhance staffing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient care quality. Additionally, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to monitor performance trends, identify bottlenecks, and implement data-driven improvements for a more efficient emergency room experience.

## Problem Statement
Hospitals seek to derive actionable insights from emergency room data to better understand patient flow, optimize resource allocation, and enhance service quality. There is a need to analyze patient attributes such as wait times, satisfaction scores, admission patterns, and departmental referrals across distinct demographic segments. Understanding these patterns enables healthcare providers to identify operational bottlenecks, improve patient management, and implement targeted strategies—ultimately enhancing patient experience, care efficiency, and overall hospital performance.

## Objective
This analysis aims to extract actionable insights from hospital emergency room data, with a focus on understanding patient flow, operational efficiency, and enhancing service delivery.

The specific objectives of this analysis include:

• **Providing a structured overview of the dataset, highlighting key patient attributes such as wait times, satisfaction scores, age, gender, race, and departmental referrals.**

• **Segmenting patients based on demographic and operational factors to identify patterns in admissions, referrals, and service utilization.**

• **Analyzing relationships between patient demographics, wait times, and satisfaction scores to uncover operational bottlenecks and areas for improvement.**

• **Enabling data-driven decision-making through an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports resource optimization, improved patient care strategies, and enhanced emergency room management.**

## Key features
The dashboard addresses the following aspects:

✨ **Patient Flow and Admission Analysis:**
Tracked total patients, admission rates, and discharge patterns using dynamic area sparklines and bar charts to monitor emergency room load and capacity over time.

✨ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
Cleaned and transformed raw hospital data using Power Query, handled missing values, corrected data types, and ensured data consistency for precise and reliable analysis.

✨ **Demographic & Operational Visualizations:**
Utilized stacked bar charts, pie charts, and clustered column charts to illustrate patient distribution by gender, age groups, race, and admission status, offering clear demographic insights.

✨ **Wait Time & Satisfaction Score Analysis:**
Visualized daily and monthly trends of average patient wait times and satisfaction scores using area charts and KPI cards, highlighting operational bottlenecks and service quality.

✨ **Department Referral Analysis:**
Analyzed referral patterns across various departments like General Practice, Orthopedics, and Cardiology using bar charts and pie charts to identify areas requiring resource optimization.

✨ **Dynamic Filtering with Slicers:**
Enabled interactive slicers for Gender, Race, Admission Status, Department, and Date fields to allow user-driven, real-time exploration of emergency room performance.

✨ **KPI Summary Cards:**
Displayed key metrics such as Total Patients, Average Wait Time, Patient Satisfaction Score, and Number of Referrals through clearly labeled KPI cards for quick, actionable insights.

✨ **DAX Measures & Calculated Columns:**
Created custom DAX measures and calculated columns to compute KPIs like average wait time, admission rates, satisfaction trends, and patients seen within 30 minutes.

✨ **Detailed Patient Data Tables with Drill-Through:**
Built interactive data tables with conditional formatting, allowing users to view detailed patient information and drill-through for deeper analysis at the individual level.

✨ **Bookmark-Based Navigation:**
Implemented Power BI Bookmarks for seamless transitions between dashboard views like Monthly Overview, Consolidated View, Patient Details, and Key Takeaways, enhancing the storytelling experience.

✨ **User-Friendly & Interactive Dashboard Design:**
Focused on a clean, intuitive layout with responsive visuals and smooth interactivity, ensuring that healthcare professionals and administrators can easily derive insights and take action.
